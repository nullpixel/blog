Well, hello there. I'm nullpixel, and I make iOS apps. I do web apps too. 

## Who are you?

Why would you care? I don't know, but either way, I'm going to tell you. I started iOS development way back in 2012/2013 - where I made my first app in Objective C. I loved the experience, and I continued developing. 

I joined the /r/jailbreak community when I got my first iOS device - an iPod Touch 2nd generation. I've created numerous tweaks for the community since 2015. You can see my cydia repo at [repo.nullpixel.uk](https://repo.nullpixel.uk), where some of my smaller tweaks are.

## Projects

* [canvas.place](https://canvas.place): when reddit decided to make /r/place as their 2017 April Fools prank, it was very saddening when they stopped it - it proved humans could interact at scale. That's why the team @ [dynastic](https://dynastic.co) decided to recreate it. It's fully opensource on [github](https://github.com/dynastic/place)

* [TSS Saver iOS](https://repo.nullpixel.uk/depiction/co.dynastic.tsssaver/): an iOS app for 1conans TSSSaver.

## Contact

I'm on [github](https://github.com/nullpixel), [twitter](https://twitter.com/nullriver), [discord](https://discordapp.com) (nullpixel#0012), [reddit](https://reddit.com/user/nullpixel) and many other things under the name `nullpixel` or `nullriver`.
